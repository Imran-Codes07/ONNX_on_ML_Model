ONNX-Based Machine Learning Model
This repository demonstrates how to convert a trained machine learning model into ONNX format and then load and use the ONNX model for inference.

🧑‍💻 Project Setup
Follow these instructions to set up the project and run the code.

🔧 Requirements
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install onnxruntime scikit-learn joblib numpy  
📂 Files in This Repository
train_and_save_model.py: Trains a simple machine learning model using scikit-learn, saves it as a .joblib file, and converts it to ONNX format.

load_onnx_model.py: Loads the ONNX model and runs inference on test data.

🚀 How to Run the Code
Train the Model and Convert to ONNX
Run the following command to train and save the model in ONNX format:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_and_save_model.py  
This will generate the following files:

ml_model.joblib: The original machine learning model.

ml_model.onnx: The converted ONNX model.

Run Inference on the ONNX Model
Run the ONNX inference code with the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python load_onnx_model.py  
This will output predictions on the test data.

📝 Code Explanation
1. Training and Saving the Model (train_and_save_model.py)
This file trains a simple machine learning model using a DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
After training:

The model is saved as ml_model.joblib using joblib.

It is then converted into ONNX format using the skl2onnx library.

2. Loading and Running the ONNX Model (load_onnx_model.py)
This file demonstrates how to load the saved ml_model.onnx file using the onnxruntime library and run inference on the test dataset.

🔮 What is ONNX?
ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-source format designed to make machine learning models portable across frameworks. It allows you to train a model in one framework (like scikit-learn) and use it in another environment with minimal effort.

🌟 Key Features
Framework Portability: Convert machine learning models into ONNX format.

Efficient Inference: Leverage onnxruntime for optimized inference speed.

Minimal Dependencies: Only core Python libraries (numpy, onnxruntime, etc.) are required.
