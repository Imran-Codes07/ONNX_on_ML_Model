ONNX on ML Model
This repository contains code for deploying and testing machine learning models using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX). ONNX provides an open standard for representing machine learning models, enabling interoperability between different frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and others.

Overview
The project demonstrates:

How to convert trained machine learning models to ONNX format.

How to load and run ONNX models for inference.

Performance benchmarking of ONNX models compared to traditional models.

Features
Model Conversion: Convert models from popular frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) to ONNX format.

Inference Testing: Load and perform inference using ONNX models.

Interoperability: Run the same ONNX model across different platforms and environments.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python (>= 3.8)

ONNX (pip install onnx)

ONNX Runtime (pip install onnxruntime)

NumPy (pip install numpy)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Imran-Codes07/ONNX_on_ML_Model.git
cd ONNX_on_ML_Model
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Follow these steps to run the code:

Convert a Model to ONNX:

Modify convert_to_onnx.py to include your trained model and run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python convert_to_onnx.py
Run Inference:

Use the provided run_inference.py script to load and test the ONNX model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python run_inference.py
Example Code Snippets
Here are brief code snippets:

Convert a PyTorch Model to ONNX:
python
Copy
Edit
import torch
import torch.onnx

# Load your trained PyTorch model
model = torch.load("my_model.pth")
dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

# Convert to ONNX
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx")
Run Inference with ONNX Runtime:
python
Copy
Edit
import onnxruntime
import numpy as np

# Load the ONNX model
session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession("model.onnx")

# Prepare input and run inference
input_data = np.random.rand(1, 3, 224, 224).astype(np.float32)
result = session.run(None, {"input": input_data})
print("Inference result:", result)
